was worshipped as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic. She was
the friend of slaves, sinners, artisans and the downtrodden, but she also listened to the prayers of the
wealthy, maidens, aristocrats and rulers. Isis is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-
headed deity associated with king and kingship (although in some traditions Horus's mother was
Hathor). Isis is also known as protector of the dead and goddess of children. The name Isis means
""Throne"". Her headdress is a throne. As the personification of the throne, she was an important
representation of the pharaoh's power.

ISIS.! lol lol lol ----------- 1.) TRUMAN-EISENHOWER-IMF-OFAC-USAID On September 4, 1961, the
Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act, which reorganized the U.S. foreign assistance programs
including separating military and non-military aid. The Act mandated the creation of an agency to
administer economic assistance programs, and on November 3, 1961, President John F. Kennedy
established the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Historical Perspective The 1961
reorganization of America's foreign aid programs resulted from an increasing dissatisfaction with the
foreign assistance structures that had evolved from the days of the Marshall Plan, to which USAID and
U.S. foreign assistance policy traces its roots. By the end of World War II, Europe had suffered
substantial loses, physically and economically. Responding to Europe's calls for help, the international
community established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) on December 27, 1945. On April 2, 1948, through
the enactment of the Economic Cooperation Act, the United States responded by creating the Marshall
Plan. While the IMF and the World Bank were created as permanent institutions, the goal of the
Marshall Plan was specific: To stabilize Europe, not as a permanent program for European recovery
but as an emergency tool of assistance. In 1953, the Foreign Operations Administration was
established as an independent government agency outside the Department of State, to consolidate
economic and technical assistance on a world-wide basis. Its responsibilities were merged into the
International Cooperation Administration (ICA) one year later. The ICA administered aid for economic,
political and social development purposes. Although the ICA's functions were vast and far reaching,
unlike USAID, ICA had many limitations placed upon it. As a part of the Department of State, ICA did
not have the level of autonomy the USAID currently maintains. At the time, multilateral donors (such as
those affiliated with the United Nations and the Organization of American States) were playing a
greater role in foreign assistance Congressional approval of a revised Mutual Security Act in 1957 lead
to the creation of the Development Loan Fund (DLF), which acted as the ICA's lending arm. The DLF's
primary function was to extend loans of a kind that the Export-Import Bank and other donors were not
interested in or prepared to underwrite - those repayable in local currencies. The DLF financed
everything other than technical assistance but was most noteworthy for financing capital projects.
Neither the ICA nor the DLF addressed the need for a long-range foreign development program. That
led to the creation of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The 1961 Foreign Assistance Act
By 1960, the support from the American public and Congress for the existing foreign assistance
programs had dwindled. The growing dissatisfaction with foreign assistance, highlighted by the book
The Ugly American, prompted Congress and the Eisenhower Administration to focus U.S. aid to
developing nations, which became an issue during the 1960 U.S. presidential campaign.

DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY, ""OFAC"" ""OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL."" TERRORISM
AND FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department
of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy
and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international
narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.
OFAC acts under Presidential national emergency powers, as well as authority granted by specific
legislation, to impose controls on transactions and freeze assets under US jurisdiction. Many of the
sanctions are based on United Nations and other international mandates, are multilateral in scope, and
involve close cooperation with allied governments. The Treasury Department has a long history of
dealing with sanctions. Dating back prior to the War of 1812, Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin
administered sanctions imposed against Great Britain for the harassment of American sailors. During
the Civil War, Congress approved a law which prohibited transactions with the Confederacy, called for
the forfeiture of goods involved in such transactions, and provided a licensing regime under rules and
regulations administered by Treasury. OFAC is the successor to the Office of Foreign Funds Control
(the ``FFC''), which was established at the advent of World War II following the German invasion of

(the ``FFC''), which was established at the advent of World War II following the German invasion of
Norway in 1940. The FFC program was administered by the Secretary of the Treasury throughout the
war. The FFC's initial purpose was to prevent Nazi use of the occupied countries' holdings of foreign
exchange and securities and to prevent forced repatriation of funds belonging to nationals of those
countries. These controls were later extended to protect assets of other invaded countries. After the
United States formally entered World War II, the FFC played a leading role in economic warfare
against the Axis powers by blocking enemy assets and prohibiting foreign trade and financial
transactions. OFAC itself was formally created in December 1950, following the entry of China into the
Korean War, when President Truman declared a national emergency and blocked all Chinese and
North Korean assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence develops and implements U.S. government strategies to combat terrorist
financing domestically and internationally, develops and implements the National Money Laundering
Strategy as well as other policies and programs to fight financial crimes. The Office of Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence (TFI) marshals the department's intelligence and enforcement functions with the
twin aims of safeguarding the financial system against illicit use and combating rogue nations, terrorist
facilitators, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferators, money launderers, drug kingpins, and
other national security threats. Mission Organization Key Topics Resources Designations are an
important resource in TFI's prosecution of the war on financial terror. With them, TFI is able to freeze
the assets of individuals and groups who seek out to commit terrorist acts, as well as those entities
who attempt to support them. When examining individuals or organizations for potential designation,
the United States works in conjunction with authorities from several other nations, and with
international organizations, such as the European Union and the United Nations. For more, please visit
Sanctions, OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals List and FinCEN's Advisories. Money Laundering
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an international policy-making and standard-setting body
dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Created by the G-7 in 1989 in
response to a growing concern about money laundering, the FATF's mission is to monitor members'
progress in implementing necessary measures, review money laundering and terrorist financing
techniques and counter-measures, and promote the adoption and implementation of appropriate
measures globally. Members of the TFI staff chair the U.S. delegation to the FATF, and it has been an
important organization resource in centralizing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist
financing. The delegation, which also includes members of the Departments of State and Justice, the
National Security Council, and federal financial regulators, develops U.S. positions, represent the U.S.
at FATF meetings, and implement actions domestically to meet the U.S. commitment to the FATF. For
more information, please visit http://www.fatf-gafi.org/. Protecting Charitable Organizations from
terrorist abuse is a critical component of the global fight against terrorism. Charities provide essential
services, comfort, and hope to those in need around the world. Unfortunately, terrorists have exploited
the charitable sector to raise and move funds, provide logistical support, encourage terrorist
recruitment, or otherwise support terrorist organizations and operations. This abuse threatens to
undermine donor confidence and jeopardizes the integrity of the charitable sector, whose services are
indispensable to the world community. Hawala & Alternative Remittance Systems provide fast and
cost-effective methods for worldwide remittance of money or value, particularly for persons who may
be outside the reach of the traditional financial sector. In some nations hawala is illegal, in others the
activity is considered a part of the â€œgrayâ€ economy. It is therefore difficult to accurately measure the
total volume of financial activity associated with the system, however, it is estimated that the figures
are in the tens of billions of dollars, at a minimum. The very features which make hawala attractive to
legitimate customers (mainly expatriates remitting money to relatives in their home country) ---
efficiency, anonymity, and lack of a paper trail---also make the system attractive for the transfer of illicit
funds. On October 31, 2001 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released the Eight Special
Recommendations on Terrorist Financing which, when combined with the FATF Forty
Recommendations on money laundering, set out the basic framework to detect, prevent, and suppress
the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) was initiatived
after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 to identify, track, and pursue terrorists â€“ such as Al-
Qaida â€“ and their networks. Since that time, the TFTP has provided valuable leads that have aided in
the prevention or investigation of many of the most visible and violent terrorist attacks and attempted
attacks of the past decade http://www.treasury.gov/â€¦/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.â€¦ ----------------

""Thirteen Days"" Robert F. Kennedy 1968, Read this book, A Real factual and hypnotic outline. With it,
You can reference any current Historical or Military Crisis and understand it. Last night I slept with the
TV on Fox as usual, I kept waking up hearing the same old trap of history, Terrorism, Isis,, Iran, Syria,
Taliban, Al QUIDA and this Stupid Delusional Profit Mohammed with a joint in his mouth and a ""Magic
Carpet Ride"" all of which equals a Suicidal Kamikaze Ideation to Hitlerism. â€œThe general feeling in the
beginning was that some form of action was required. There were those, although they were a small
minority, who felt the missiles did not alter the balance of power and therefore necessitated no action.
Most felt, at that stage, that an air strike against the missile sites could be the only course. Listening to
the proposals, I passed a note to the President: â€œI now know how Tojo felt when he was planning Pearl
Harborâ€ We now should Screw these Mohammed's, Bomb them all immediately and through the Irish
Catholic Bible at Them. Along with English Dictionaries. The solution to ""History Repeats itself"" is to hit
them as you would the Ottoman Empire as usual. THEN REFOCUS ON THE SCHOOLING SYSTEM

the President, Ted Sorensen, Kenny Oâ€™Donnell, and I sat in his office and talked. â€œThe great danger
and risk in all of this,â€ he said, â€œis a miscalculationâ€”a mistake in judgment.â€ A short time before, he
had read Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s book The Guns of August, and he talked about the miscalculations of the
Germans, the Russians, the Austrians, the French, and the British. They somehow seemed to tumble
into war, he said, through stupidity, individual idiosyncrasies, misunderstandings, and personal
complexes of inferiority and grandeur. We talked about the miscalculation of the Germans in 1939 and
the still unfulfilled commitments and guarantees that the British had given to Poland. Neither side
wanted war over Cuba, we agreed, but it was possible that either side could take a step thatâ€”for

wanted war over Cuba, we agreed, but it was possible that either side could take a step thatâ€”for
reasons of â€œsecurityâ€ or â€œprideâ€ or â€œfaceâ€â€”would require a response by the other side, which, in turn,
for the same reasons of security, pride, or face, would bring about a counterresponse and eventually
an escalation into armed conflict. That was what he wanted to avoid. He did not want anyone to be
able to say that the U.S. had not done all it could to[â€¦]â€ â€œa long time. While I was there, he placed
telephone calls to former Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. As I was leaving, he said, making
reference to Abraham Lincoln, â€œThis is the night I should go to the theater.â€ I said, â€œIf you go, I want to
go with you.â€ As I closed the door, he was seated at the desk writing a letter to Mrs. Andersonâ€¦.â€ â€œAs
mentioned before, Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s The Guns of August had made a great impression on the
President. â€œI am not going to follow a course which will allow anyone to write a comparable book about
this time, The Missiles of October,â€ he said to me that Saturday night, October 26. â€œIf anybody is
around to write after this, they are going to understand that we made every effort to find peace and
every effort to give our adversary room to move. I am not going to push the Russians an inch beyond
what is necessary.â€ After it was finished, he made no statement attempting to take credit for himself or
for the Administration for what had occurred. He instructed all members of the Ex Comm and
government that no interview should be given, no statement made, which would claim any kind of
victory. He respected Khrushchev for properly determining what was in his own countryâ€™s interest and
what was in the interest of mankind. If it was a triumph, it was a triumph for the NEXT GENERATION
and not for any particular government or people. Prince von BÃ¼low, of GERMANY said to his
successor, â€œHow did it all happen?â€ â€œAh, if only we knew,â€ was the reply. NOTE It was Senator
Kennedyâ€™s intention to add a discussion of the basic ethical question involved: what, if any,
circumstance or justification gives this government or any government the moral right to bring its
people and possibly all people under the shadow of nuclear destruction? He wrote this book in the
summer and fall of 1967 on the basis of his personal diaries and recollections, but never had an

House Barack Obama Trey Gowdy Darrell Issa * * * * * Charles J. Forester http://www.foxnews.com/on-
air/justice-jeanine/index.html From President Truman on, each President has written a note of thanks
to the men and women of the CIA. These notes are displayed with the Presidentâ€™s official photograph
in the Presidential Gallery of the New Headquarters Building. This story is the second in a series about
the relationship each president has had with the CIA. This article will focus on President George H.W.
Bush. * * * * * After the demise of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, President
George H.W. Bush declared that a â€œNew World Orderâ€ had emerged. However, President Bush
cautioned the nation that while it would be less dangerous than before, it would be dangerous
nonetheless. With Desert Shield in 1990 and the U.S. intervention in Somalia in 1992, President Bushâ€™s
point was made crystal clear. A Need for Intelligence During his term, President Bush made many trips
to CIA Headquarters, always emphasizing that intelligence was still of great importance in the post-
Soviet world. â€œThe challenge of the excellent men and women in Langley and elsewhere in the
Intelligence Community is to move beyond the Cold War to the complex problems of the 21st century.
Tomorrowâ€™s Intelligence Community will need to consolidate and extend freedomâ€™s gains against
totalitarianism. Intelligence will enhance our protection against terrorism, against the drug menace.
Intelligence will help our policymakers understand emerging economic opportunities and challenges. It
will help us thwart anyone who tries to steal our technology or otherwise refuses to play by the
competitive rules. It will help us seek peace and avert conflicts in regions of dangerous tension.â€
George Bush as DCI George H. W. Bush is the first president to have served as the Director of Central
Intelligence (DCI). He served as DCI from January 1976 to January 1977. During Bushâ€™s presidency,
his experience as DCI gave him an insiderâ€™s knowledge of the Intelligence Community and how it

operated. When DCI Bush came to the Agency, the investigations of the Senateâ€™s Church Committee
â€”which rocked the Intelligence Community â€” were just coming to a close. DCI Bush was credited with
restoring the morale of Agency employees during a time of great turbulence. George Bush Center for
Intelligence In April 1999, the CIA Headquarters compound was designated the â€œGeorge Bush Center
for Intelligenceâ€ in honor of the former DCI and president. Agency employees, former Directors and
Deputy Directors of Central Intelligence, colleagues, friends, and family members joined former
President Bush at the dedication ceremony. Carrying on the tradition started by President Truman
following the Agencyâ€™s founding, President Bush wrote a note thanking the men and women of the CIA
for their service to the United States. He is the 11th president to write a note for the CIAâ€™s Presidentsâ€™
Gallery: â€œTo the CIA, an indispensable Agency â€” especially to the men and women who serve with
such dedication and distinction.â€ Related Stories and Links: Presidential Reflections on U.S.

audiences 12. Khatami concluding speech, shaking hands and leaving hall STORYLINE: Former
Iranian president Mohammed Khatami on Sunday condemned the September 11 attacks, but
defended groups such as Hezbollah for what he characterised as resistance against Israeli
colonialism. He made the remarks during a speech at Harvard University on the eve of the fifth
anniversary of the September 11 attacks, where he was met by chanting protesters, many angrily
calling on him to stand up for human rights. Police estimated that 200 were in the crowd that blamed
him for failing to stop government crackdowns on student activists in Tehran during his two terms in
office. There were no major problems, but police presence was heavy. One man was briefly detained
during the protests, but police later said there were no arrests. In a 30-minute speech given under tight
security at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Khatami repeatedly praised the concept of
democracy but said American politicians, since World War II, have been infatuated with ""world
domination."" Khatami, who spoke through a translator, said he was one of the first world leaders to
condemn ""the barbarous acts"" of Sept. 11. Khatami denied that Iran helps fund the Lebanese militant
group Hezbollah, but defended the organisation's right to exist, saying no action that it ever committed
fell ""under the definition of terrorism."" ""Hezbollah today is a symbol of Lebanese resistance,"" he added.
The former president was considered a reformist during his two terms as president that ended last
year. His visit to the United States has been criticised by many, particularly amid concerns about Iran's
nuclear programme. Khatami is the most senior Iranian to travel outside New York in the United States
since Islamic fundamentalists seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held Americans hostage
for 444 days. He was invited to the United States by the U.N.-sponsored Alliance of Civilisations, of
which he is a founding member. The group strives to foster cross-cultural understanding between
Western and Islamic states. You can license this story through AP Archive:

of Ptolemyâ€™s Geographia. We love Ptolemy at the #MapCenter: he was a 2nd century Greco-Egyptian
geographer, mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer whose work had an enormous impact on the
geographical understandings of Renaissance Europe and the medieval Caliphate. Just think: the
Geographia was originally published in 150 AD, and explorersâ€”including Christopher Columbusâ€”
continued to rely upon his text over 1300 years later. Thatâ€™s some legacy! As an aside: itâ€™s doubtful that
our 16th century friend Jacopo encountered a tiger in real life, but based on this tigerâ€™s humanoid
expression of existential guilt, we have to wonder if he had ever even met a house cat; everyone
knows that cats are fluffy maniacs incapable of guilt, existential or otherwise. #cartozoology

they were broadcasting a live report from a strip mall. At first, I thought this was an ISIS attack
overseas -- which isn't any less jarring --but this is so close to home, and it is shocking. Ben and I just
listened to Barack Obama's interview from a few weeks ago on @marcmaron's ""#WTFpodcast"", and
now all I can think about are the things our president said about gun control, and the way he can't ever
seem to get any cooperation from Congress on the matter. I am not a political person â€¦ and I usually
do not talk about politics, because I'm not terribly passionate about them, and it's really no fun opening
my mouth, and having a bunch of overheated people swatting at me because they think I've said
something stupidâ€¦ but, for just this one time, I feel extra opinionated today, so I am just going to
speak from my heart:: I know we all love our freedom, and the right to bear arms was such a big
victory for us back in the 1700s, but ::::::we are not in the 1700s anymore:::::. And, while we have a
society, it's not really a uniform society; we're made up of a bunch of mini-societies, all of whom march
to their own drummers. That is the beauty of our freedom, but this easy access to gun thing -- that, I
think, is a downside of it. It is really, really time to do to guns, what we did to the Confederate flag. I'm
honestly just heartsick. All good thoughts to the friends and families affected by this tragedy, and I pray
that Vicki Gardner makes a full recovery. â¤à¸€ #Virginia #shooting #gunlaws #heartbreak

society in near total chaos, as happened in Iraq in 2003, what happens next? Why were Shiites more
successful in limiting violence and providing public goods than Sunnis were in Iraq? Why have many
women in the Middle East resorted to increasingly conservative modes of dress in recent decades?
Many of the current conflicts in the Middle East have been attributed to sectarianism, a politicization of
ethnic and religious identity. From the crisis in Iraq and Syria to the tension between Iran and Saudi
Arabia, the struggle between Sunni and Shiites groups for dominance is tearing apart the region and
shows no signs of abating. However, for all the religious discourse permeating the conflict, much of its
roots are political, not religious. How does sectarianism fit into a larger narrative of the Middle East?
How have governments manipulated sectarian differences? And finally, what is the U.S. doing about it?

concluding speech, shaking hands and leaving hall STORYLINE: Former Iranian president Mohammed
Khatami on Sunday condemned the September 11 attacks, but defended groups such as Hezbollah
for what he characterised as resistance against Israeli colonialism. He made the remarks during a
speech at Harvard University on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, where he
was met by chanting protesters, many angrily calling on him to stand up for human rights. Police
estimated that 200 were in the crowd that blamed him for failing to stop government crackdowns on
student activists in Tehran during his two terms in office. There were no major problems, but police
presence was heavy. One man was briefly detained during the protests, but police later said there
were no arrests. In a 30-minute speech given under tight security at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government, Khatami repeatedly praised the concept of democracy but said American politicians,
since World War II, have been infatuated with ""world domination."" Khatami, who spoke through a
translator, said he was one of the first world leaders to condemn ""the barbarous acts"" of Sept. 11.
Khatami denied that Iran helps fund the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, but defended the
organisation's right to exist, saying no action that it ever committed fell ""under the definition of
terrorism."" ""Hezbollah today is a symbol of Lebanese resistance,"" he added. The former president was
considered a reformist during his two terms as president that ended last year. His visit to the United
States has been criticised by many, particularly amid concerns about Iran's nuclear programme.
Khatami is the most senior Iranian to travel outside New York in the United States since Islamic
fundamentalists seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held Americans hostage for 444 days.
He was invited to the United States by the U.N.-sponsored Alliance of Civilisations, of which he is a
founding member. The group strives to foster cross-cultural understanding between Western and
Islamic states. You can license this story through AP Archive:

""Thirteen Days"" Robert F. Kennedy 1968, Read this book, A Real factual and hypnotic outline. With it,
You can reference any current Historical or Military Crisis and understand it. Last night I slept with the
TV on Fox as usual, I kept waking up hearing the same old trap of history, Terrorism, Isis,, Iran, Syria,
Taliban, Al QUIDA and this Stupid Delusional Profit Mohammed with a joint in his mouth and a ""Magic
Carpet Ride"" all of which equals a Suicidal Kamikaze Ideation to Hitlerism. â€œThe general feeling in the
beginning was that some form of action was required. There were those, although they were a small
minority, who felt the missiles did not alter the balance of power and therefore necessitated no action.
Most felt, at that stage, that an air strike against the missile sites could be the only course. Listening to
the proposals, I passed a note to the President: â€œI now know how Tojo felt when he was planning Pearl
Harborâ€ We now should Screw these Mohammed's, Bomb them all immediately and through the Irish
Catholic Bible at Them. Along with English Dictionaries. The solution to ""History Repeats itself"" is to hit
them as you would the Ottoman Empire as usual. THEN REFOCUS ON THE SCHOOLING SYSTEM
OLD SCHOOL CATHOLIC TEACHING AND AS HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF START TEACHING
HISTORY FROM ALL THE OLD SCHOOL MILITARY BOOKS SUCH AS THE GUNS OF AUGUST,
WHILE ENGLAND SLEPT, THE UGLY AMERICAN, PATTON AND ""THIRTEEN DAYS"" REMBER IT I
VITAL TO BOMB AND STIKE IRAN, ISIS, AND SYRIA NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ACTIVE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO SUSTAIN A WAR SCREW THESE DOPE ADDICT MOHAMMED'S.! THEY
WILL LOSE HANDS DOWN.!!!! NOW. PG 62: ""The Important meeting of the OAS"" â€œAfter the meeting,
the President, Ted Sorensen, Kenny Oâ€™Donnell, and I sat in his office and talked. â€œThe great danger
and risk in all of this,â€ he said, â€œis a miscalculationâ€”a mistake in judgment.â€ A short time before, he
had read Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s book The Guns of August, and he talked about the miscalculations of the
Germans, the Russians, the Austrians, the French, and the British. They somehow seemed to tumble
into war, he said, through stupidity, individual idiosyncrasies, misunderstandings, and personal
complexes of inferiority and grandeur. We talked about the miscalculation of the Germans in 1939 and
the still unfulfilled commitments and guarantees that the British had given to Poland. Neither side
wanted war over Cuba, we agreed, but it was possible that either side could take a step thatâ€”for
reasons of â€œsecurityâ€ or â€œprideâ€ or â€œfaceâ€â€”would require a response by the other side, which, in turn,
for the same reasons of security, pride, or face, would bring about a counterresponse and eventually
an escalation into armed conflict. That was what he wanted to avoid. He did not want anyone to be
able to say that the U.S. had not done all it could to[â€¦]â€ â€œa long time. While I was there, he placed
telephone calls to former Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. As I was leaving, he said, making
reference to Abraham Lincoln, â€œThis is the night I should go to the theater.â€ I said, â€œIf you go, I want to
go with you.â€ As I closed the door, he was seated at the desk writing a letter to Mrs. Andersonâ€¦.â€ â€œAs
mentioned before, Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s The Guns of August had made a great impression on the
President. â€œI am not going to follow a course which will allow anyone to write a comparable book about
this time, The Missiles of October,â€ he said to me that Saturday night, October 26. â€œIf anybody is

this time, The Missiles of October,â€ he said to me that Saturday night, October 26. â€œIf anybody is
around to write after this, they are going to understand that we made every effort to find peace and
every effort to give our adversary room to move. I am not going to push the Russians an inch beyond
what is necessary.â€ After it was finished, he made no statement attempting to take credit for himself or
for the Administration for what had occurred. He instructed all members of the Ex Comm and
government that no interview should be given, no statement made, which would claim any kind of
victory. He respected Khrushchev for properly determining what was in his own countryâ€™s interest and
what was in the interest of mankind. If it was a triumph, it was a triumph for the NEXT GENERATION
and not for any particular government or people. Prince von BÃ¼low, of GERMANY said to his
successor, â€œHow did it all happen?â€ â€œAh, if only we knew,â€ was the reply. NOTE It was Senator
Kennedyâ€™s intention to add a discussion of the basic ethical question involved: what, if any,
circumstance or justification gives this government or any government the moral right to bring its
people and possibly all people under the shadow of nuclear destruction? He wrote this book in the
summer and fall of 1967 on the basis of his personal diaries and recollections, but never had an

Judge Jeanine Pirro for President http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/justice-jeanine/index.html The White
House Barack Obama Trey Gowdy Darrell Issa Charles J. Forester http://www.foxnews.com/on-
air/justice-jeanine/index.html From President Truman on, each President has written a note of thanks
to the men and women of the CIA. These notes are displayed with the Presidentâ€™s official photograph
in the Presidential Gallery of the New Headquarters Building. This story is the second in a series about
the relationship each president has had with the CIA. This article will focus on President George H.W.
Bush. * * * * * After the demise of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, President
George H.W. Bush declared that a â€œNew World Orderâ€ had emerged. However, President Bush
cautioned the nation that while it would be less dangerous than before, it would be dangerous
nonetheless. With Desert Shield in 1990 and the U.S. intervention in Somalia in 1992, President Bushâ€™s
point was made crystal clear. A Need for Intelligence During his term, President Bush made many trips
to CIA Headquarters, always emphasizing that intelligence was still of great importance in the post-
Soviet world. â€œThe challenge of the excellent men and women in Langley and elsewhere in the
Intelligence Community is to move beyond the Cold War to the complex problems of the 21st century.
Tomorrowâ€™s Intelligence Community will need to consolidate and extend freedomâ€™s gains against
totalitarianism. Intelligence will enhance our protection against terrorism, against the drug menace.
Intelligence will help our policymakers understand emerging economic opportunities and challenges. It
will help us thwart anyone who tries to steal our technology or otherwise refuses to play by the
competitive rules. It will help us seek peace and avert conflicts in regions of dangerous tension.â€
George Bush as DCI George H. W. Bush is the first president to have served as the Director of Central
Intelligence (DCI). He served as DCI from January 1976 to January 1977. During Bushâ€™s presidency,
his experience as DCI gave him an insiderâ€™s knowledge of the Intelligence Community and how it
operated. When DCI Bush came to the Agency, the investigations of the Senateâ€™s Church Committee
â€”which rocked the Intelligence Community â€” were just coming to a close. DCI Bush was credited with
restoring the morale of Agency employees during a time of great turbulence. George Bush Center for
Intelligence In April 1999, the CIA Headquarters compound was designated the â€œGeorge Bush Center
for Intelligenceâ€ in honor of the former DCI and president. Agency employees, former Directors and
Deputy Directors of Central Intelligence, colleagues, friends, and family members joined former
President Bush at the dedication ceremony. Carrying on the tradition started by President Truman
following the Agencyâ€™s founding, President Bush wrote a note thanking the men and women of the CIA
for their service to the United States. He is the 11th president to write a note for the CIAâ€™s Presidentsâ€™
Gallery: â€œTo the CIA, an indispensable Agency â€” especially to the men and women who serve with

such dedication and distinction.â€ Related Stories and Links: Presidential Reflections on U.S.

""Thirteen Days"" Robert F. Kennedy 1968, Read this book, A Real factual and hypnotic outline. With it,
You can reference any current Historical or Military Crisis and understand it. Last night I slept with the
TV on Fox as usual, I kept waking up hearing the same old trap of history, Terrorism, Isis,, Iran, Syria,
Taliban, Al QUIDA and this Stupid Delusional Profit Mohammed with a joint in his mouth and a ""Magic
Carpet Ride"" all of which equals a Suicidal Kamikaze Ideation to Hitlerism. â€œThe general feeling in the
beginning was that some form of action was required. There were those, although they were a small
minority, who felt the missiles did not alter the balance of power and therefore necessitated no action.
Most felt, at that stage, that an air strike against the missile sites could be the only course. Listening to
the proposals, I passed a note to the President: â€œI now know how Tojo felt when he was planning Pearl
Harborâ€ We now should Screw these Mohammed's, Bomb them all immediately and through the Irish
Catholic Bible at Them. Along with English Dictionaries. The solution to ""History Repeats itself"" is to hit
them as you would the Ottoman Empire as usual. THEN REFOCUS ON THE SCHOOLING SYSTEM
OLD SCHOOL CATHOLIC TEACHING AND AS HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF START TEACHING
HISTORY FROM ALL THE OLD SCHOOL MILITARY BOOKS SUCH AS THE GUNS OF AUGUST,
WHILE ENGLAND SLEPT, THE UGLY AMERICAN, PATTON AND ""THIRTEEN DAYS"" REMBER IT I
VITAL TO BOMB AND STIKE IRAN, ISIS, AND SYRIA NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ACTIVE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO SUSTAIN A WAR SCREW THESE DOPE ADDICT MOHAMMED'S.! THEY
WILL LOSE HANDS DOWN.!!!! NOW. PG 62: ""The Important meeting of the OAS"" â€œAfter the meeting,
the President, Ted Sorensen, Kenny Oâ€™Donnell, and I sat in his office and talked. â€œThe great danger
and risk in all of this,â€ he said, â€œis a miscalculationâ€”a mistake in judgment.â€ A short time before, he
had read Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s book The Guns of August, and he talked about the miscalculations of the
Germans, the Russians, the Austrians, the French, and the British. They somehow seemed to tumble
into war, he said, through stupidity, individual idiosyncrasies, misunderstandings, and personal
complexes of inferiority and grandeur. We talked about the miscalculation of the Germans in 1939 and
the still unfulfilled commitments and guarantees that the British had given to Poland. Neither side
wanted war over Cuba, we agreed, but it was possible that either side could take a step thatâ€”for
reasons of â€œsecurityâ€ or â€œprideâ€ or â€œfaceâ€â€”would require a response by the other side, which, in turn,
for the same reasons of security, pride, or face, would bring about a counterresponse and eventually
an escalation into armed conflict. That was what he wanted to avoid. He did not want anyone to be
able to say that the U.S. had not done all it could to[â€¦]â€ â€œa long time. While I was there, he placed
telephone calls to former Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. As I was leaving, he said, making
reference to Abraham Lincoln, â€œThis is the night I should go to the theater.â€ I said, â€œIf you go, I want to
go with you.â€ As I closed the door, he was seated at the desk writing a letter to Mrs. Andersonâ€¦.â€ â€œAs
mentioned before, Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s The Guns of August had made a great impression on the
President. â€œI am not going to follow a course which will allow anyone to write a comparable book about

President. â€œI am not going to follow a course which will allow anyone to write a comparable book about
this time, The Missiles of October,â€ he said to me that Saturday night, October 26. â€œIf anybody is
around to write after this, they are going to understand that we made every effort to find peace and
every effort to give our adversary room to move. I am not going to push the Russians an inch beyond
what is necessary.â€ After it was finished, he made no statement attempting to take credit for himself or
for the Administration for what had occurred. He instructed all members of the Ex Comm and
government that no interview should be given, no statement made, which would claim any kind of
victory. He respected Khrushchev for properly determining what was in his own countryâ€™s interest and
what was in the interest of mankind. If it was a triumph, it was a triumph for the NEXT GENERATION
and not for any particular government or people. Prince von BÃ¼low, of GERMANY said to his
successor, â€œHow did it all happen?â€ â€œAh, if only we knew,â€ was the reply. NOTE It was Senator
Kennedyâ€™s intention to add a discussion of the basic ethical question involved: what, if any,
circumstance or justification gives this government or any government the moral right to bring its
people and possibly all people under the shadow of nuclear destruction? He wrote this book in the
summer and fall of 1967 on the basis of his personal diaries and recollections, but never had an

Judge Jeanine Pirro for President http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/justice-jeanine/index.html The White
House Barack Obama Trey Gowdy Darrell Issa Charles J. Forester http://www.foxnews.com/on-
air/justice-jeanine/index.html From President Truman on, each President has written a note of thanks
to the men and women of the CIA. These notes are displayed with the Presidentâ€™s official photograph
in the Presidential Gallery of the New Headquarters Building. This story is the second in a series about
the relationship each president has had with the CIA. This article will focus on President George H.W.
Bush. * * * * * After the demise of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, President
George H.W. Bush declared that a â€œNew World Orderâ€ had emerged. However, President Bush
cautioned the nation that while it would be less dangerous than before, it would be dangerous
nonetheless. With Desert Shield in 1990 and the U.S. intervention in Somalia in 1992, President Bushâ€™s
point was made crystal clear. A Need for Intelligence During his term, President Bush made many trips
to CIA Headquarters, always emphasizing that intelligence was still of great importance in the post-
Soviet world. â€œThe challenge of the excellent men and women in Langley and elsewhere in the
Intelligence Community is to move beyond the Cold War to the complex problems of the 21st century.
Tomorrowâ€™s Intelligence Community will need to consolidate and extend freedomâ€™s gains against
totalitarianism. Intelligence will enhance our protection against terrorism, against the drug menace.
Intelligence will help our policymakers understand emerging economic opportunities and challenges. It
will help us thwart anyone who tries to steal our technology or otherwise refuses to play by the
competitive rules. It will help us seek peace and avert conflicts in regions of dangerous tension.â€
George Bush as DCI George H. W. Bush is the first president to have served as the Director of Central
Intelligence (DCI). He served as DCI from January 1976 to January 1977. During Bushâ€™s presidency,
his experience as DCI gave him an insiderâ€™s knowledge of the Intelligence Community and how it
operated. When DCI Bush came to the Agency, the investigations of the Senateâ€™s Church Committee
â€”which rocked the Intelligence Community â€” were just coming to a close. DCI Bush was credited with
restoring the morale of Agency employees during a time of great turbulence. George Bush Center for
Intelligence In April 1999, the CIA Headquarters compound was designated the â€œGeorge Bush Center
for Intelligenceâ€ in honor of the former DCI and president. Agency employees, former Directors and
Deputy Directors of Central Intelligence, colleagues, friends, and family members joined former
President Bush at the dedication ceremony. Carrying on the tradition started by President Truman
following the Agencyâ€™s founding, President Bush wrote a note thanking the men and women of the CIA
for their service to the United States. He is the 11th president to write a note for the CIAâ€™s Presidentsâ€™

http://www.actvism.org/donate/ Im ersten Video kommentiert Prof. Noam Chomsky die Terrorattacken
in Paris, die vom selbsternannten Islamischen Staat (IS/ISIL/ISIS/DAESH) ausgeÃ¼bt wurden. Eine
Zusammenfassung der Attacken in Paris: Am 13. November 2015 fand eine Reihe von Terrorattacken
in Paris statt, welche 130 Menschenleben und etwa 368 Verletzte forderten. Ziele der Attacken waren
das Stade de France in Saint-Denis, das von drei SelbstmordattentÃ¤tern attackiert wurde, der
Bataclan-Konzertsaal, wo Geiseln genommen wurden und es die mit Abstand meisten Toten gab,
sowie CafÃ©s und Restaurant in Paris. Der selbsternannte Islamische Staat (IS/ISIL/ISIS/DAESH)
bekannte sich zu den Attacken und bezeichnete sie als Vergeltungsaktion fÃ¼r die franzÃ¶sischen
Luftangriffe gegen den IS in Syrien & Irak. Am 15. November 2015 antwortete Frankreich mit einem
weiteren Luftangriff: 12 Flugzeuge, die insgesamt 20 Bomben abwarfen. Der Angriff war Teil von
OpÃ©ration Chammal, einer MilitÃ¤roperation, die am 19. September 2014 in Syrien und Irak initiiert
wurde. Die IS-Attacke gilt als die â€žtÃ¶dlichsteâ€œ auf franzÃ¶sischem Boden seit dem Pariser Massaker am
17. Oktober 1961, das von der franzÃ¶sischen Nationalpolizei ausgeÃ¼bt wurde und etwa 200
Menschenleben forderte.

OFAC-USAID On September 4, 1961, the Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act, which
reorganized the U.S. foreign assistance programs including separating military and non-military aid.
The Act mandated the creation of an agency to administer economic assistance programs, and on
November 3, 1961, President John F. Kennedy established the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID). Historical Perspective The 1961 reorganization of America's foreign aid
programs resulted from an increasing dissatisfaction with the foreign assistance structures that had
evolved from the days of the Marshall Plan, to which USAID and U.S. foreign assistance policy traces
its roots. By the end of World War II, Europe had suffered substantial loses, physically and
economically. Responding to Europe's calls for help, the international community established the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(the World Bank) on December 27, 1945. On April 2, 1948, through the enactment of the Economic
Cooperation Act, the United States responded by creating the Marshall Plan. While the IMF and the
World Bank were created as permanent institutions, the goal of the Marshall Plan was specific: To
stabilize Europe, not as a permanent program for European recovery but as an emergency tool of
assistance. In 1953, the Foreign Operations Administration was established as an independent
government agency outside the Department of State, to consolidate economic and technical
assistance on a world-wide basis. Its responsibilities were merged into the International Cooperation
Administration (ICA) one year later. The ICA administered aid for economic, political and social
development purposes. Although the ICA's functions were vast and far reaching, unlike USAID, ICA
had many limitations placed upon it. As a part of the Department of State, ICA did not have the level of
autonomy the USAID currently maintains. At the time, multilateral donors (such as those affiliated with
the United Nations and the Organization of American States) were playing a greater role in foreign
assistance Congressional approval of a revised Mutual Security Act in 1957 lead to the creation of the
Development Loan Fund (DLF), which acted as the ICA's lending arm. The DLF's primary function was
to extend loans of a kind that the Export-Import Bank and other donors were not interested in or
prepared to underwrite - those repayable in local currencies. The DLF financed everything other than
technical assistance but was most noteworthy for financing capital projects. Neither the ICA nor the
DLF addressed the need for a long-range foreign development program. That led to the creation of
the U.S. Agency for International Development. The 1961 Foreign Assistance Act By 1960, the support
from the American public and Congress for the existing foreign assistance programs had dwindled.
The growing dissatisfaction with foreign assistance, highlighted by the book The Ugly American,
prompted Congress and the Eisenhower Administration to focus U.S. aid to developing nations, which
became an issue during the 1960 U.S. presidential campaign.

DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY, ""OFAC"" ""OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL."" TERRORISM
AND FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department
of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy
and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international
narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.
OFAC acts under Presidential national emergency powers, as well as authority granted by specific
legislation, to impose controls on transactions and freeze assets under US jurisdiction. Many of the
sanctions are based on United Nations and other international mandates, are multilateral in scope, and
involve close cooperation with allied governments. The Treasury Department has a long history of
dealing with sanctions. Dating back prior to the War of 1812, Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin
administered sanctions imposed against Great Britain for the harassment of American sailors. During
the Civil War, Congress approved a law which prohibited transactions with the Confederacy, called for
the forfeiture of goods involved in such transactions, and provided a licensing regime under rules and
regulations administered by Treasury. OFAC is the successor to the Office of Foreign Funds Control
(the ``FFC''), which was established at the advent of World War II following the German invasion of
Norway in 1940. The FFC program was administered by the Secretary of the Treasury throughout the
war. The FFC's initial purpose was to prevent Nazi use of the occupied countries' holdings of foreign
exchange and securities and to prevent forced repatriation of funds belonging to nationals of those
countries. These controls were later extended to protect assets of other invaded countries. After the
United States formally entered World War II, the FFC played a leading role in economic warfare
against the Axis powers by blocking enemy assets and prohibiting foreign trade and financial
transactions. OFAC itself was formally created in December 1950, following the entry of China into the
Korean War, when President Truman declared a national emergency and blocked all Chinese and
North Korean assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence develops and implements U.S. government strategies to combat terrorist
financing domestically and internationally, develops and implements the National Money Laundering
Strategy as well as other policies and programs to fight financial crimes. The Office of Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence (TFI) marshals the department's intelligence and enforcement functions with the
twin aims of safeguarding the financial system against illicit use and combating rogue nations, terrorist
facilitators, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferators, money launderers, drug kingpins, and
other national security threats. Mission Organization Key Topics Resources Designations are an
important resource in TFI's prosecution of the war on financial terror. With them, TFI is able to freeze
the assets of individuals and groups who seek out to commit terrorist acts, as well as those entities
who attempt to support them. When examining individuals or organizations for potential designation,
the United States works in conjunction with authorities from several other nations, and with
international organizations, such as the European Union and the United Nations. For more, please visit
Sanctions, OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals List and FinCEN's Advisories. Money Laundering
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an international policy-making and standard-setting body
dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Created by the G-7 in 1989 in
response to a growing concern about money laundering, the FATF's mission is to monitor members'
progress in implementing necessary measures, review money laundering and terrorist financing
techniques and counter-measures, and promote the adoption and implementation of appropriate
measures globally. Members of the TFI staff chair the U.S. delegation to the FATF, and it has been an
important organization resource in centralizing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist
financing. The delegation, which also includes members of the Departments of State and Justice, the
National Security Council, and federal financial regulators, develops U.S. positions, represent the U.S.
at FATF meetings, and implement actions domestically to meet the U.S. commitment to the FATF. For
more information, please visit http://www.fatf-gafi.org/. Protecting Charitable Organizations from
terrorist abuse is a critical component of the global fight against terrorism. Charities provide essential
services, comfort, and hope to those in need around the world. Unfortunately, terrorists have exploited
the charitable sector to raise and move funds, provide logistical support, encourage terrorist
recruitment, or otherwise support terrorist organizations and operations. This abuse threatens to
undermine donor confidence and jeopardizes the integrity of the charitable sector, whose services are
indispensable to the world community. Hawala & Alternative Remittance Systems provide fast and
cost-effective methods for worldwide remittance of money or value, particularly for persons who may
be outside the reach of the traditional financial sector. In some nations hawala is illegal, in others the
activity is considered a part of the â€œgrayâ€ economy. It is therefore difficult to accurately measure the
total volume of financial activity associated with the system, however, it is estimated that the figures
are in the tens of billions of dollars, at a minimum. The very features which make hawala attractive to
legitimate customers (mainly expatriates remitting money to relatives in their home country) ---
efficiency, anonymity, and lack of a paper trail---also make the system attractive for the transfer of illicit
funds. On October 31, 2001 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released the Eight Special

funds. On October 31, 2001 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released the Eight Special
Recommendations on Terrorist Financing which, when combined with the FATF Forty
Recommendations on money laundering, set out the basic framework to detect, prevent, and suppress
the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) was initiatived
after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 to identify, track, and pursue terrorists â€“ such as Al-
Qaida â€“ and their networks. Since that time, the TFTP has provided valuable leads that have aided in
the prevention or investigation of many of the most visible and violent terrorist attacks and attempted
attacks of the past decade http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-

""Thirteen Days"" Robert F. Kennedy 1968, Read this book, A Real factual and hypnotic outline. With it,
You can reference any current Historical or Military Crisis and understand it. Last night I slept with the
TV on Fox as usual, I kept waking up hearing the same old trap of history, Terrorism, Isis,, Iran, Syria,
Taliban, Al QUIDA and this Stupid Delusional Profit Mohammed with a joint in his mouth and a ""Magic
Carpet Ride"" all of which equals a Suicidal Kamikaze Ideation to Hitlerism. â€œThe general feeling in the
beginning was that some form of action was required. There were those, although they were a small
minority, who felt the missiles did not alter the balance of power and therefore necessitated no action.
Most felt, at that stage, that an air strike against the missile sites could be the only course. Listening to
the proposals, I passed a note to the President: â€œI now know how Tojo felt when he was planning Pearl

Harborâ€ We now should Screw these Mohammed's, Bomb them all immediately and through the Irish
Catholic Bible at Them. Along with English Dictionaries. The solution to ""History Repeats itself"" is to hit
them as you would the Ottoman Empire as usual. THEN REFOCUS ON THE SCHOOLING SYSTEM
OLD SCHOOL CATHOLIC TEACHING AND AS HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF START TEACHING
HISTORY FROM ALL THE OLD SCHOOL MILITARY BOOKS SUCH AS THE GUNS OF AUGUST,
WHILE ENGLAND SLEPT, THE UGLY AMERICAN, PATTON AND ""THIRTEEN DAYS"" REMBER IT I
VITAL TO BOMB AND STIKE IRAN, ISIS, AND SYRIA NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ACTIVE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO SUSTAIN A WAR SCREW THESE DOPE ADDICT MOHAMMED'S.! THEY
WILL LOSE HANDS DOWN.!!!! NOW. PG 62: ""The Important meeting of the OAS"" â€œAfter the meeting,
the President, Ted Sorensen, Kenny Oâ€™Donnell, and I sat in his office and talked. â€œThe great danger
and risk in all of this,â€ he said, â€œis a miscalculationâ€”a mistake in judgment.â€ A short time before, he
had read Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s book The Guns of August, and he talked about the miscalculations of the
Germans, the Russians, the Austrians, the French, and the British. They somehow seemed to tumble
into war, he said, through stupidity, individual idiosyncrasies, misunderstandings, and personal
complexes of inferiority and grandeur. We talked about the miscalculation of the Germans in 1939 and
the still unfulfilled commitments and guarantees that the British had given to Poland. Neither side
wanted war over Cuba, we agreed, but it was possible that either side could take a step thatâ€”for
reasons of â€œsecurityâ€ or â€œprideâ€ or â€œfaceâ€â€”would require a response by the other side, which, in turn,
for the same reasons of security, pride, or face, would bring about a counterresponse and eventually
an escalation into armed conflict. That was what he wanted to avoid. He did not want anyone to be
able to say that the U.S. had not done all it could to[â€¦]â€ â€œa long time. While I was there, he placed
telephone calls to former Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. As I was leaving, he said, making
reference to Abraham Lincoln, â€œThis is the night I should go to the theater.â€ I said, â€œIf you go, I want to
go with you.â€ As I closed the door, he was seated at the desk writing a letter to Mrs. Andersonâ€¦.â€ â€œAs
mentioned before, Barbara Tuchmanâ€™s The Guns of August had made a great impression on the
President. â€œI am not going to follow a course which will allow anyone to write a comparable book about
this time, The Missiles of October,â€ he said to me that Saturday night, October 26. â€œIf anybody is
around to write after this, they are going to understand that we made every effort to find peace and
every effort to give our adversary room to move. I am not going to push the Russians an inch beyond
what is necessary.â€ After it was finished, he made no statement attempting to take credit for himself or
for the Administration for what had occurred. He instructed all members of the Ex Comm and
government that no interview should be given, no statement made, which would claim any kind of
victory. He respected Khrushchev for properly determining what was in his own countryâ€™s interest and
what was in the interest of mankind. If it was a triumph, it was a triumph for the NEXT GENERATION
and not for any particular government or people. Prince von BÃ¼low, of GERMANY said to his
successor, â€œHow did it all happen?â€ â€œAh, if only we knew,â€ was the reply. NOTE It was Senator
Kennedyâ€™s intention to add a discussion of the basic ethical question involved: what, if any,
circumstance or justification gives this government or any government the moral right to bring its
people and possibly all people under the shadow of nuclear destruction? He wrote this book in the
summer and fall of 1967 on the basis of his personal diaries and recollections, but never had an

House Barack Obama Trey Gowdy Darrell Issa * * * * * Charles J. Forester http://www.foxnews.com/on-

to the men and women of the CIA. These notes are displayed with the Presidentâ€™s official photograph
in the Presidential Gallery of the New Headquarters Building. This story is the second in a series about
the relationship each president has had with the CIA. This article will focus on President George H.W.

the relationship each president has had with the CIA. This article will focus on President George H.W.
Bush. * * * * * After the demise of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, President
George H.W. Bush declared that a â€œNew World Orderâ€ had emerged. However, President Bush
cautioned the nation that while it would be less dangerous than before, it would be dangerous
nonetheless. With Desert Shield in 1990 and the U.S. intervention in Somalia in 1992, President Bushâ€™s
point was made crystal clear. A Need for Intelligence During his term, President Bush made many trips
to CIA Headquarters, always emphasizing that intelligence was still of great importance in the post-
Soviet world. â€œThe challenge of the excellent men and women in Langley and elsewhere in the
Intelligence Community is to move beyond the Cold War to the complex problems of the 21st century.
Tomorrowâ€™s Intelligence Community will need to consolidate and extend freedomâ€™s gains against
totalitarianism. Intelligence will enhance our protection against terrorism, against the drug menace.
Intelligence will help our policymakers understand emerging economic opportunities and challenges. It
will help us thwart anyone who tries to steal our technology or otherwise refuses to play by the
competitive rules. It will help us seek peace and avert conflicts in regions of dangerous tension.â€
George Bush as DCI George H. W. Bush is the first president to have served as the Director of Central
Intelligence (DCI). He served as DCI from January 1976 to January 1977. During Bushâ€™s presidency,
his experience as DCI gave him an insiderâ€™s knowledge of the Intelligence Community and how it
operated. When DCI Bush came to the Agency, the investigations of the Senateâ€™s Church Committee
â€”which rocked the Intelligence Community â€” were just coming to a close. DCI Bush was credited with
restoring the morale of Agency employees during a time of great turbulence. George Bush Center for
Intelligence In April 1999, the CIA Headquarters compound was designated the â€œGeorge Bush Center
for Intelligenceâ€ in honor of the former DCI and president. Agency employees, former Directors and
Deputy Directors of Central Intelligence, colleagues, friends, and family members joined former
President Bush at the dedication ceremony. Carrying on the tradition started by President Truman
following the Agencyâ€™s founding, President Bush wrote a note thanking the men and women of the CIA
for their service to the United States. He is the 11th president to write a note for the CIAâ€™s Presidentsâ€™

such dedication and distinction.â€ Related Stories and Links: Presidential Reflections on U.S.

2015,  Prof.Noam Chomsky took part in an event titled ""Germany's role in the European Union and
International Affairs: Post War History, Present and Possible futures"" hosted by acTVism Munich.  Due
to limited financial resources, personnel and technical capacities, we plan to release the entire event in
a ""mini-video"" format. This format provides us with sufficient time to translate the content into multiple
language and also subtitle & voice-synchronize it for people with hearing & visual impairment. Please
donate to assist us in the production and publishing process: http://www.actvism.org/en/donate/ In this
video Prof. Noam Chomsky comments on the recent terror attacks in Paris committed by the self-
proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/ISIS/DAESH) . Summary of the Terror attacks in
Paris: On the 13th of November 2015, a number of terrorist attacks took place in Paris which claimed
the lives of 130 people and injured circa 368. Targets included the Stade de France in San Denis,
which was struck by three suicide bombers, the Bataclan concert venue, where an hostage situation
ensued resulting in the majority of deaths, and around cafes and restaurants in Paris. The self
proclaimed â€œIslamic State of Iraq and the Levantâ€ (ISIL/ISIS/DAESH) took responsibility for the attacks
stating that it was in retaliation against French air strikes targeted on ISIL in Syria & Iraq. On the 15th
of November, 2015, France responded by launching another air strike involving 12 planes that
dropped 20 bombs. This air strike was conducted under OpÃ©ration Chammal, which was initially
launched on the 19th of September 2014 in Syria & Iraq. ISILâ€™s attacks are considered one of the
â€œdeadliestâ€ on French soil since the â€œParis Massacre on October 17, 1961â€, which was committed by
the French National Police that claimed the lives of circa 200 people.

the store, got the art department polaroid camera, and headed back. I was the guy who made all of
the laminates for the in-store signings (back then it was Rage Against the Machine, Danzig, Eminem,
etc) so I managed to talk a woman into letting me take a picture of her holding my skateboard, so I
could get a shot of the laminate. I skated back to Tower, made as close to a replica as possible, and

who died while being held captive by ISIS, was repeatedly raped by the terror group's leader in Syria,
her family confirmed Friday. U.S. officials told the family in June of the assaults by ISIS leader Abu
Bakr al-Baghdadi, a representative of Mueller's family told NBC News. The sexual assaults are the
latest outrage by ISIS, which has published graphic videos showing the beheading of captives, among
other atrocities. Mueller, a 26-year-old from Prescott, Arizona, was captured by the terror group in
Syria in August 2013, and in February the U.S. confirmed she died in ISIS captivity.

This past week was filled with a lot of tears and a lot of questions. Feeling the weight of how far
humanity has fallen and how broken our world can be shatters my heart (Mizzou, the ISIS attacks, all
of it). But even in the deepest pit of exhausting discouragement I am so thankful for God's nearness.
Last night for a moment the sun made my room glow the most beautiful shade of purple. Sitting there I
could feel his warmth and sweetness towards me, he knew I needed that from him. How intentionally
he crafted that precise moment for me to enjoy! // I guess what I wanted to share with you is that God
hears you. When I read that Psalm I cried out to Him and said ""God show me your goodness in this
world"" and he responded! He said ""Here you go. I want you to see this because I love you, Nicole"" and
guess what y'all he loves you too. His heart bleeds for this world just as much as ours do. Cry out to
him. #prayforparis #prayformizzou #prayforbeirut #prayforbaghdad

celebration. I noticed that the staff / volunteers had bright orange laminated passes, so I went back to
the store, got the art department polaroid camera, and headed back. I was the guy who made all of
the laminates for the in-store signings (back then it was Rage Against the Machine, Danzig, Eminem,
etc) so I managed to talk a woman into letting me take a picture of her holding my skateboard, so I
could get a shot of the laminate. I skated back to Tower, made as close to a replica as possible, and

also in my early 20's) but on July 3rd, 1999 I was working at Tower Records on Newbury Street in
Boston and headed down by the Esplanade while they were setting up for the 4th of July fireworks
celebration. I noticed that the staff / volunteers had bright orange laminated passes, so I went back to
the store, got the art department polaroid camera, and headed back. I was the guy who made all of
the laminates for the in-store signings (back then it was Rage Against the Machine, Danzig, Eminem,
etc) so I managed to talk a woman into letting me take a picture of her holding my skateboard, so I
could get a shot of the laminate. I skated back to Tower, made as close to a replica as possible, and
on the night of the 4th, got to watch the fireworks (and orchestra) from the side of the hatch shell stage
with literally not a second glance from anybody the entire night (cid:1)à¸€à¸€

also in my early 20's) but on July 3rd, 1999 I was working at Tower Records on Newbury Street in
Boston and headed down by the Esplanade while they were setting up for the 4th of July fireworks
celebration. I noticed that the staff / volunteers had bright orange laminated passes, so I went back to
the store, got the art department polaroid camera, and headed back. I was the guy who made all of
the laminates for the in-store signings (back then it was Rage Against the Machine, Danzig, Eminem,
etc) so I managed to talk a woman into letting me take a picture of her holding my skateboard, so I
could get a shot of the laminate. I skated back to Tower, made as close to a replica as possible, and
on the night of the 4th, got to watch the fireworks (and orchestra) from the side of the hatch shell stage
with literally not a second glance from anybody the entire night (cid:1)à¸€à¸€

also in my early 20's) but on July 3rd, 1999 I was working at Tower Records on Newbury Street in
Boston and headed down by the Esplanade while they were setting up for the 4th of July fireworks
celebration. I noticed that the staff / volunteers had bright orange laminated passes, so I went back to
the store, got the art department polaroid camera, and headed back. I was the guy who made all of
the laminates for the in-store signings (back then it was Rage Against the Machine, Danzig, Eminem,
etc) so I managed to talk a woman into letting me take a picture of her holding my skateboard, so I
could get a shot of the laminate. I skated back to Tower, made as close to a replica as possible, and
on the night of the 4th, got to watch the fireworks (and orchestra) from the side of the hatch shell stage
with literally not a second glance from anybody the entire night (cid:1)à¸€à¸€
